## Section 1: General Info

The project is the simulation of going to Movie Theaters and purchase tickets to go see a movie. The project made the simulation super safe for children because their limit is watching either G or PG rated movies.

## Section 3: Behind the Scenes

I learned to create extra files that are not on the list of files needed for Assignment 6. The Assignment required another package for certain files because trying to run the program all on the default package won’t work, and it cannot be changed. With the four extra files, I basically copied and pasted what I typed with some modifications to save time.
Trying to set up the “MovieTicketManager” file along with the extra files that support it had to be tough because using certain methods will be referenced and used from the original files. Trying to run without noticing the package name causes an error when the file is not in the certain package, along with the other files that would be referenced to the main file.
Sorting out files not only made the Assignment easier to keep track of your files, but it is a requirement. We learned to add another package for certain files a few months ago, but we weren’t required to do that for the previous Assignments.
